To block APK files from being installed on an Android device, you can create a script that monitors the device for newly downloaded APK files and automatically deletes them. Here's a simple script to achieve this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Directory to monitor for downloaded APK files
download_dir="/sdcard/Download"

# Infinite loop to continuously monitor the directory
while true; do
    # Check for new APK files in the download directory
    new_apks=$(find "$download_dir" -name "*.apk" -type f 2>/dev/null)

    # If new APK files are found, delete them
    if [ -n "$new_apks" ]; then
        echo "Blocking APK files..."
        echo "$new_apks" | xargs rm -f
    fi

    # Sleep for 60 seconds before checking again
    sleep 60
done
```

Save this script to a file, for example, `block_apk.sh`, and make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x block_apk.sh
```

Then, you can run the script on your Android device using a terminal emulator app or via ADB (Android Debug Bridge).

This script continuously monitors the specified directory (`/sdcard/Download` in this example) for newly downloaded APK files. When it detects new APK files, it deletes them automatically. Adjust the `download_dir` variable to point to the directory where your device saves downloaded files.

Please note that running this script will permanently delete any APK files downloaded to the specified directory, so use it with caution. Additionally, this script requires a rooted device to access and delete files in system directories.
