To search the entire filesystem for APK files on an Android device, you can use the `find` command to recursively search all directories. Here's how you can modify the script to achieve this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Directory to start the search
search_dir="/"

# Find all APK files in the entire filesystem
apks=$(find "$search_dir" -type f -name "*.apk" 2>/dev/null)

# Check if any APK files were found
if [ -n "$apks" ]; then
    echo "APK files found:"
    echo "$apks"
else
    echo "No APK files found in the entire filesystem"
fi
```

Save this script to a file, for example, `search_apk.sh`, and make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x search_apk.sh
```

Then, you can run the script on your Android device using a terminal emulator app or via ADB (Android Debug Bridge).

This script searches the entire filesystem starting from the root directory (`/`) for APK files and lists them if any are found. The script uses the `find` command with the `-type f` option to search only for files and the `-name "*.apk"` option to match files with the `.apk` extension.

Please note that searching the entire filesystem may take some time and consume resources. Additionally, accessing certain directories may require root access, so the script may not be able to detect APK files stored in restricted directories without root permissions.
